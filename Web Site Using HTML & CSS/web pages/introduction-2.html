				     <p>Travel is the movement of people between geographically distant locations.Traveling by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane,
					 ship, or other means, with or without luggage, can be one way or round trip.As in the case of tourism, travel can also include relatively short stays between
					 successive movements.</p>

				     <p>Traveling is an important part of life because it is the best way to get away from a hectic schedule.
				     It is also to live life in a variety of ways.
				     Traveling is a great way to relieve stress, anxiety, and depression.
				     It also benefits both mental and physical health.
                     We only have one life, and we should be grateful for it for making us the most advanced creatures on the planet.
				     Not only do we get to see the beauty of nature, but we also get to see different geographies, topographies, and people.
				     Traveling is about discovering new places, cultures, cuisines, rituals, and ways of life. We also travel because distance and difference are the hidden poisons of learning and creativity that one cannot see while sitting at home.</p>

				     <p>Humans require travel to function properly. 
				     We are communal creatures of the same species, but our geographical location determines societal actions based on cultural and governmental laws.
				     We are so similar, yet our little worlds are so dissimilar. Traveling to see places other than our hometown is essential for broadening our horizons. Traveling, whether domestically or internationally, can be an experience that is remembered for a lifetime.
				     Traveling should be enjoyable, even if it is only for business to another state.
				     It is critical to maintain a consistent pattern of learning and awareness throughout one's life, and traveling is an excellent way to do so.</p>
